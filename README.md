## Overview

Univer MCP is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables AI applications to interact with and automate spreadsheet operations using the powerful [Univer](https://github.com/dream-num/univer) framework. It bridges the gap between AI language models and spreadsheet functionality, allowing for intelligent spreadsheets processing and automation.

## Key Features

- **üìä Spreadsheet Operations**: Full support for creating, editing, and manipulating spreadsheets
- **üîß Extensible Architecture**: Built on Univer's plugin system for custom functionality
- **‚ö° High Performance**: Leverages Univer's optimized rendering and calculation engines
- **üìà Advanced Features**: Formulas, conditional formatting, data validation, and more
- **ü§ñ AI Integration**: Seamless integration with MCP-compatible AI applications
- **üåê Cross-Platform[WIP]**: Works across web browsers and Node.js environments
- **üîÑ Real-time Collaboration[WIP]**: Support for collaborative editing and real-time updates

## How It Works

- MCP host: such as cursor, claude code, or the agents you built.  
- Univer MCP Server: provides the endpoint for univer mcp, which proxies tool calls to the univer instance for execution.
- mcp-bridge: this is a [univer plugin](https://docs.univer.ai/guides/recipes/architecture/univer#plugins) used to handle various spreadsheet commands in mcp.
- univer instance: the runtime environment of univer (spreadsheet).


## Quick Start

### Get API Key
First, you need to get an API key from the [API Keys page](https://console.univer.ai/apikeys). This key will be used to authenticate your MCP server connection.

### Start Univer Instance

Before you talk to LLM, you need to launch a univer instance, which is a spreadsheet runtime where you will see the contents of the spreadsheet and how it is being operated.

There are two ways to start a univer instance quickly:
1. Use the [Univer MCP Playground](https://console.univer.ai/playground) to start a univer instance.
2. Use the [Univer MCP Start-kit](https://github.com/dream-num/univer-mcp-start-kit) to start a univer instance.

### Configure MCP Server

Add the following configuration to your MCP client settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "univer": {
      "url": "https://mcp.univer.ai/mcp/?univer_session_id=<SESSION_ID>",
      "type": "http",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <API_KEY>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
> [!TIP]
> `<SESSION_ID>` is the session id of your Univer session. `default` is the default session id.
